# Unicode Flutter App

A cross-platform (Flutter) mobile application for exploring, searching, and learning about Unicode characters. Developed as part of Google Summer of Code for Unicode, Inc.

## Purpose

The Unicode Flutter App is designed to help users:
- Browse and search the entire Unicode character set
- View detailed information about each character (name, code point, block, plane, category, etc.)
- Save favorite characters for quick access
- Track and revisit recently viewed characters
- Test multilingual text rendering
- Explore Unicode blocks and categories

This app is ideal for developers, linguists, typographers, and anyone interested in Unicode and internationalization.

## Features
- **Unicode Explorer:** Search and filter Unicode characters by name, code point, block, or category.
- **Character Details:** View comprehensive metadata for each character.
- **Favorites:** Save and manage a list of favorite Unicode characters.
- **Recently Viewed:** Quickly access your recently viewed characters.
- **Multilingual Tester:** Test how different scripts and characters render on your device.
- **Settings:** Customize app preferences.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Android, iOS, and Web.
